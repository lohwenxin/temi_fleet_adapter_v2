'''
    The RobotAPI class is a wrapper for API calls to the robot. Here users
    are expected to fill up the implementations of functions which will be used
    by the RobotCommandHandle. For example, if your robot has a REST API, you
    will need to make http request calls to the appropriate endpoints within
    these functions.
